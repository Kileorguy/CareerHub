About Atlas MedStaff
We think your recruiter and your travel healthcare agency should care about you. Our team has lots of crazy ideas like that. Like co-founders who are transparent, a tight-knit community for our travelers, creating content that tells *your* story, and helping you find adventure.
Every Atlas traveler gets an Atlas Adventure™, an adventure that is uniquely *you*. Skiing, mountain climbing, skydiving, or even just a weekend at a spa or tickets to a concert you can’t wait for.
We have been ranked #1 by BluePipes as the best travel healthcare agency. And received the distinction of being the highest-rated travel healthcare staffing agency by Great Recruiters. Both of those recognitions are fueled by real reviews by real travel nurses and allied healthcare professionals that work with our team.
Atlas has been recognized as one of the fastest-growing companies in the country by INC; the fastest-growing staffing company in the country, and the fastest-growing healthcare staffing company in the country by Staffing Industry Analysts; and we recently received the AMN Perfect Partner Award. Many of these recognitions we have won multiple times.
Awards are great, but it's our travelers — our people — that we are most proud of. And every Atlas traveler is part of our team. You may not be in the office (heck, we’re not either since a lot of our team has been working remote since the pandemic), but you are part of the Atlas Community.
